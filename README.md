1. Task1 We created 3 classes: "Accountant", "Director" and "Worker" - with the fields "Position name" and "Position code".
   Created interface "IGetInfo" to create a method for displaying information about a position.
   Created class "Runner", where the class instances were created.
   The user can enter the position code from the console, and the compiler outputs the name of this position.
2. Task2 We created abstract class "Figure" to create a common characteristic of all shapes and add methods to find the perimeter and area of the shapes.
   We created classes to describe a circle, rectangle and triangle and describe methods for calculating the perimeter and area of figures.
   Created class "Runner", where the class instances were created.
   We placed the instances of the class in an array, went through the array and output information about each shape and
   the sum of the perimeters of all shapes.
